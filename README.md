# Kanban Task Board (IndexedDB + Native Drag & Drop)

A lightweight **Kanban-style task management board** built with **Next.js, TypeScript, and IndexedDB (Dexie)** featuring persistent storage and smooth native drag-and-drop interactions.

---
## 🏗 Tech Stack Explanation

This project uses **Next.js with TypeScript** to ensure scalable structure, type safety, and modern React architecture through the App Router.
**IndexedDB via Dexie** was chosen for reliable client-side persistence without requiring a backend, enabling offline capability.
**Native HTML5 drag-and-drop** was used instead of external libraries to keep the implementation lightweight, dependency-free, and stable for the assignment scope.

## 🤖 AI Tool Usage

AI tools were used selectively to support early-stage development and learning:

* Assisted in **initial architecture planning**, including reducer structure and overall drag-and-drop flow
* Helped with **debugging and refactoring** to improve code clarity, separation of concerns, and maintainable structure
* Provided guidance while learning **React useReducer**, which was unfamiliar at the start of the project
* Supported troubleshooting when attempting **dnd-kit–based drag-and-drop**; after encountering stability issues, the final implementation was rebuilt using **native HTML5 drag-and-drop**
* Primarily used for an **initial productivity boost** after creating the base layout and core project setup independently

All final implementation decisions, code structure, and testing were completed manually.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations

* Tasks **cannot yet be reordered within the same column** (only moved across columns)
* Drag-and-drop currently supports **mouse interaction only** (no keyboard accessibility)
* Data is stored **locally in the browser**, so it does not sync across devices

These are identified as **future improvement areas**.

---

## 🚀 Possible Future Improvements

* Reordering tasks **within the same column**
* Search/filter tasks by title
* Backend sync
